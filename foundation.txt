GRAPH APPROXIMATOR
Author : Jeffrin Santon T

PROJECT OVERVIEW

A full stack application to approximate discrete data points to a function as a string

Database Design

1. TABLE users (
    user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
)


Description
Users table contains user id, name, email which is used to store the users data to identify a single user among users.


2.TABLE Sessions(
        session_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
           user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
            session_name TEXT NOT NULL,
            description TEXT,
            created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)


Description
Sessions table contain session details such as session id, name, user id, description, created and updated time stamp
The user id is a foreign key to map with the user table


3.TABLE data_points(
point_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            session_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    x_value REAL NOT NULL,
    y_value REAL NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES sessions(session_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)


Description
Data points table contains all the data points created by multiple users and they are mapped to the session table using session id foreign key
It stores data points as x value and y value


Backend Design API end points


User Endpoints

POST /user - Create new user
PUT /user/{id} - Update user information
DELETE /user/{id} - Delete user
GET user/{id} - Get user information


Session Endpoints

POST /session - Create new session
PUT /session - Update session information
DELETE /session/{id} - Delete session
GET /session/{id} - Get user information
GET /session/{user_id} - Get all the sessions belongs to a particular user


Datapoint Endpoints

POST /datapoint - Create new datapoints
PUT /datapoint - Update datapoint
DELETE /datapoint/{id} - Delete datapoint
GET /datapoint/{id} - Get datapoint information
GET /datapoint/{session_id} - Get all datapoints belongs to a particular session

Approximator Endpoints:

POST /approximate/series/{session_id} - Get approximated function using taylor series
POST /approximate/polynomial/{session_id} - Get approximated function using polynomial regression 
POST /approximate/linear/{session_id} - Get approximated function using linear regression
